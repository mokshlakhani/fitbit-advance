// The regime under test is the one the NIGHT detector deliberately rejects:
// `AdvancedSleepStager.minSleepMin = 60` exists so "daytime naps and stray
// still-blocks stay excluded" (advanced_stager.dart:327), and anything centred
// 11:00–20:00 local additionally needs ≥90 min plus an HR dip. Reusing that
// detector for naps made the canonical 20–45 min afternoon nap structurally
// undetectable. These tests pin the new, purpose-built path.
