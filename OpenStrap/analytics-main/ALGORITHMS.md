# OpenStrap Analytics — Algorithms

Every metric here is a **published, peer-reviewed method**, computed by a **pure
deterministic function**, running on the 1 Hz substrate a WHOOP 4.0 actually exposes:
beat-to-beat RR (pulse-derived — this is **PRV, not ECG-HRV**, and that distinction
matters more than it sounds like it should), 1 Hz heart rate, 1 Hz tri-axial accel, and
relative-only ADC channels (skin temp, SpO2, ambient light).

This file is the index — what's implemented, where it lives, and who published it. If a
row here doesn't have a real citation next to it, that's a bug in this file, go fix it.

See `docs/ALGORITHM_CATALOG_1HZ.md` for the underlying literature review and what's
deliberately not shipped.

Almost everything returns a `Metric<T>` envelope:

```dart
class Metric<T> {
  final T? value;
  final double confidence;   // 0..1, computed from real input coverage
  final String tier;         // Tier.auth | .high | .estimate | .relative
  final List<String> inputs_used;
  final List<Driver>? drivers;
  final String? note;        // e.g. "need_baseline:have=3,need=7"
}
```

A few multi-day/list outputs (`illnessCusum`, `multivariateAnomaly`,
`journalCorrelations`) return a plain `List<T>` instead — there's no single
confidence/tier that applies across a whole list.

**Tiers**: `AUTH` = directly measured/definitional. `HIGH` = strong literature support on
this substrate. `ESTIMATE` = published, but estimate-grade once run on a wrist 1 Hz
signal instead of a lab setup. `RELATIVE` = meaningful only as a deviation from the
user's own baseline (skin temp, SpO2 — never an absolute unit).

**Absent input → `null` + confidence `0`, always.** A baseline-gated metric that doesn't
have enough history says so explicitly via the `need_baseline:have=H,need=N` note format,
rather than computing something on partial data and hoping nobody notices.

## What this deliberately doesn't do
- No absolute SpO2/skin-temp — raw relative ADC counts only, ever (`RELATIVE` tier).
- No cause-naming — a signature ambiguous between alcohol/late meal/illness/luteal
  phase/hot room reports the *state*, never asserts which one it is.
- Irregular-rhythm is a screen, not a diagnosis — no ECG here, conservative thresholds,
  explicit non-medical framing.
- VO2max/physiological-age stay `ESTIMATE` — HR-ratio-style approximations, never
  presented as something a lab measured.
- No fabricated values. Ever. A metric without enough real data returns `null` +
  confidence `0`, with a machine-readable note saying exactly what's missing.
