//   ultra-short  : < 5 min   (RMSSD only, with caution)
//   short        : 5 min
//   24-h         : SDANN / SDNN-index use 5-min segment means / SDs.
//
// HONESTY: this is PRV (pulse-rate variability), not ECG HRV. RMSSD and pNNx
// are the metrics most biased by the 1 Hz beat-time quantization (successive-
// difference inflation) — flagged in `note`. Lead with SDNN / SDANN.

// That warning used to be advice only: every RMSSD in this file shipped, at
// confidence 0.95, however much of it was beat-timing jitter. [kNnDiffAcf1Floor]
// makes it behaviour — see that constant for the measurement and the threshold.
