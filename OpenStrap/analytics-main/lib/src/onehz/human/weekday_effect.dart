// HUMAN — does one day of the week actually cost you? (MIND-12)
//
// The question is easy to ask and almost impossible to answer honestly. Take
// any 90 days of any daily metric, split by weekday, and one of the seven will
// look worse — that is what seven groups DO. Publishing that day is a machine
// for manufacturing weekday superstitions, and it will do it on pure noise for
// every user, forever.
//
// So the gate is the feature, and it has two stages:
//
//   1. KRUSKAL-WALLIS OMNIBUS across all seven groups. Rank-based, so a couple
//      of wrecked nights do not carry it, and it asks one question — "do these
//      seven groups differ at all?" — instead of seven.
//   2. Only if that clears: a PERMUTATION TEST ON THE MAX DEVIATION. The
//      statistic is the largest |group median − overall median| over the seven,
//      and its null distribution is built by reshuffling the weekday labels. A
//      max over seven groups has a null distribution nothing like a single
//      group's, and permuting is how the 7-way selection gets paid for rather
//      than pocketed.
//
// Both p-values are permutation p-values off the SAME shuffles, so there is one
// loop and no chi-square table.
//
// HONESTY CEILING: purely descriptive and totally confounded. Saturday is not a
// cause, it is a container for everything you do on Saturdays. No advice
// attaches to this, ever, and nothing here licenses telling anyone to change a
// weekend. Under 8 weeks it is absent, not weak.
