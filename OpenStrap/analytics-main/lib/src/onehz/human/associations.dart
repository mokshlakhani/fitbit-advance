// HUMAN — what actually moves your recovery, your sleep, your strain (MIND-20).
//
// This is the single highest fabrication risk in the product. "Your insights"
// screens in consumer health apps are, almost universally, a noise generator
// with a confident font. Twenty candidate inputs against five outcomes is a
// hundred hypothesis tests; at a per-test p < 0.05 you expect five significant
// results from data with nothing in it at all, and those five ARE the screen.
// Every design decision below exists to stop that, and most of them cost power
// on purpose.
//
// The six things that make the naive version wrong, and what is done here:
//
//  1. MULTIPLICITY. Every pair that can be tested IS tested, and the whole grid
//     goes through Benjamini-Hochberg (1995) before anything is published. The
//     family is never pruned by effect size first — screening on the statistic
//     and then correcting only the survivors is the multiple-comparisons
//     problem wearing a disguise. A pair we abstained from does not enter m
//     (it is not a test we performed); a pair we ran does, however weak.
//
//  2. AUTOCORRELATION. Consecutive days are not independent — sleep debt,
//     training load, illness and mood all persist for days — and a classical
//     or naive-shuffle p on serially dependent series is badly optimistic. Two
//     independent AR(1) walks produce large sample correlations routinely, and
//     a test that shuffles days one at a time destroys exactly the structure
//     that caused them, so it calls them significant. The null here is built by
//     MOVING-BLOCK PERMUTATION: the outcome series is cut into fortnight-long
//     blocks and the BLOCKS are reordered, which keeps each series' own
//     persistence intact while destroying its alignment to the other.
//     `blockLen` is 14 days by default, which is a MEASURED choice and not a
//     natural-looking one — the false-positive rates behind it are tabulated on
//     [associationMinPairedDays], where 7 is shown failing at the persistence
//     real training and illness data actually has. The false-positive test in
//     the test-suite fails outright with day-wise shuffling and passes with
//     this, which is the rest of the justification.
//
//  3. LAG IS DIRECTIONAL AND IT IS THE POINT. Last night's sleep can move today
//     — today cannot move last night. Every variable declares WHEN IN THE DAY
//     it happened ([VarTiming]) and the lag falls out of the pair, per pair,
//     never as a global column shift. Every pair has exactly one alignment that
//     runs forwards, so no pair is ever flipped and none is ever refused for
//     direction; the same-timing pairs take +1 rather than the simultaneous 0,
//     which is where that is paid for ([associationLag]). There is deliberately
//     NO LAG SCAN: trying {0,+1,+2} triples the grid and re-creates precisely
//     the multiplicity problem the BH correction just paid for. One derived
//     lag, disclosed on the finding.
//
//  4. CONFOUNDING. Weekday drives sleep, alcohol, training and steps at the
//     same time, so "late meals hurt my recovery" is very often "Saturday".
//     Both series are WEEKDAY-ADJUSTED (per-weekday median removed) BEFORE the
//     statistic is computed, so the published number is the within-weekday
//     association and a weekend cannot manufacture it. The unadjusted rho is
//     reported alongside for disclosure, never as the verdict; when the two
//     disagree the finding carries a `weekday_confounded` caveat.
//
//  5. TAUTOLOGY. This one is specific to us and it is the worst of them.
//     Readiness IS a weighted composite of nocturnal HRV, RHR, respiratory rate
//     and skin temperature. Correlating any of those four against readiness
//     produces a huge, beautiful, perfectly meaningless finding — we would be
//     reporting our own arithmetic back to the user as a discovery. So a
//     variable declares what it is [DailyVariable.derivedFrom], and any pair
//     where one side is a constituent of the other is refused by construction.
//
//  6. REDUNDANCY. Sleep duration, time in bed and sleep efficiency will all
//     "predict" recovery, because on most nights they are one thing measured
//     three ways. Publishing all three is one insight repeated until it looks
//     like a body of evidence. Surviving findings are clustered by the observed
//     correlation BETWEEN THE INPUTS and only the strongest of each cluster is
//     published; the rest stay in [AssociationScan.tested] with a pointer.
//
// ABSENCE IS AN ANSWER. A variable that is not populated often enough is
// dropped with a reason, not imputed; a pair with too few paired days is
// refused with a reason, not run at a lower bar. An engine with three weeks of
// data and nothing solid to say returns an ABSENT metric that says how many
// nights it has and how many it needs. It never lowers the gate to fill a
// screen.
//
// HONESTY CEILING, AND IT IS THE HARD KIND. Everything here is ASSOCIATION IN
// ONE PERSON'S OWN OBSERVATIONAL HISTORY. Nothing is randomised, nothing is
// controlled beyond weekday, and an unmeasured cause behind both series is
// always available. No output of this file is advice, none of it is a
// mechanism, and none of it licenses "do more X" — the project law is
// detection, never diagnosis, and a correlation engine is the easiest place in
// the app to break it. Copy built on these findings must say what was OBSERVED
// in this person's data, with its sample size attached.

// (strain already carries the load axis), `lf_hf`, `hrv_cv`, `brv_cv`,
// `prsa_dc` (HRV shape, dominated by rmssd), `dyn_p90` (dominated by
// active_min), `skin_temp_adc` (the raw series behind skin_temp_z),
// `rhr_nocturnal` (currently identical to rhr).
//
// Excluded because they are NOT PHYSIOLOGY: `worn_min`, `unobserved_min`,
// `skin_temp_coverage_frac`, `skin_temp_settled_frac` — these measure how well
// the strap was worn, so "wearing it more is associated with sleeping more" is
// guaranteed and meaningless. `irregular_rhythm_flag` is a clinical screen and
// is never a candidate cause of anything.
//
// Excluded because the column is dead: `spo2`, `odi_per_hour`, `strain_effort`
// are null or tombstoned upstream — a column existing is not data.
//
// Excluded because they are conditional on an event, so their absence is
// informative and the pairwise-complete assumption breaks: `hrr_bpm`,
