// result class after the implementation was deleted; both are gone.
//
// THIS IS NOT KITAMURA'S OSD, and it used to say it was (SLP-03). Kitamura 2016
// (PMC5075948) defines optimal sleep duration as the ASYMPTOTE of an
// exponential-decay fit to PSG total sleep time across NINE CONSECUTIVE NIGHTS
// AT 12 h TIME IN BED: OSD 8.41 ± 0.18 h, habitual 7.37 ± 0.27 h, potential debt
// 1.04 ± 0.24 h, with night 1 at 10.59 ± 0.19 h — a 3.22 h rebound that then
// decays. The paper's whole point is that UNCONSTRAINED SLEEP IS NOT OSD; it
// understates it by about an hour.
//
// What we actually compute is `percentile(freeNightSleepH, 75)` over ordinary
// ad-lib nights — a habitual-sleep percentile. So the "debt" it yields is
// systematically near zero or negative, and downstream (`crossday_pipeline`
// clamps this into [7.0, 9.5] h and floors debt at 0.0) what most users see is
// the clamp, not a measurement. Reported as what it is: how long your longer
// unconstrained nights run, against your recent typical night.
//
// Doing it properly needs a saturating fit across a RUN of consecutive free
// days, and a refusal when no such run exists — not a wider percentile.
//
// Returns null when there is no free night yet, rather than assuming a generic
// 8 h target.
