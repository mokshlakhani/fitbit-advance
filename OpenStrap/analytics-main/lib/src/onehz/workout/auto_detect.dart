// auto_detect.dart — opt-in "did you just work out?" SUGGESTION detector.
//
// Opt-in workout suggestion detector (ported from AutoWorkoutDetector.swift).
// DELIBERATELY conservative (low sensitivity): a sustained ≥12-min elevation of
// HR ≥ max(RHR+[elevatedMarginBPM], RHR+[hrrFloorFraction]·HRR) — RHR+59 at
// RHR 60 / HRmax 190 — brief (≤90 s) dips tolerated, near windows merged,
// optional motion confirmation, overlap-excluded against saved spans.
// (The header and the note used to quote "RHR+30", the margin this detector
// deliberately abandoned: see [hrrFloorFraction] for the 30 false windows on a
// sedentary week that motivated replacing it.)
//
// This NEVER writes a row — it only ever SUGGESTS.
//
// HYBRID SEAM: every surviving bout is run through a [SportClassifier]; the
// default returns "detected" (no sport typing). OpenStrap's motion-based HAR typer
// can be injected to type each bout when high-rate accel features exist.
//
// Pure / headless: no I/O, no clock, dart:math only. All ts/start/end are unix
// SECONDS. NOT medical advice.
