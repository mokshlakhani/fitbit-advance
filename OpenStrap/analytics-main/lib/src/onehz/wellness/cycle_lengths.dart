// WELLNESS — logged cycle lengths, and the two published criterion numbers
// (WH-08).
//
// Arithmetic on LOGGED ONSET DATES ONLY. No PPG, no temperature, no HRV,
// nothing that can be wrong for sensor reasons. Consecutive-onset differencing
// and one absolute value.
//
// WHAT IT PRODUCES: her own cycle lengths, the difference between each
// consecutive pair, and the two numbers the published criteria use (Harlow
// 2012 / STRAW+10): a persistent 7-day-or-more difference between consecutive
// cycles, and a 60-day-or-longer interval. The screen renders the lengths as a
// bar series with those two lines on it and NO VERDICT TEXT AT ALL.
//
// NAMING. There is no stage vocabulary in this file and there must not be one
// added — not in a string, not in a field, not in a local variable. An
// identifier leaks into logs, into exports and eventually into a sentence on a
// screen, which is precisely how a description of arithmetic turns into a
// diagnosis nobody wrote. Everything here is named after what it computes.
//
// REFUSING ON HOLES IS THE FEATURE. This is entirely hostage to logging
// discipline: one missed start manufactures a single 60-day "cycle" that meets
// a criterion on its own. So an interval longer than [implausibleGapDays] is
// classed UNUSABLE — we cannot tell a long interval from a forgotten log — and
// its presence blocks the whole series rather than being quietly charted.
//
// This never says anyone is anything, never predicts an age, and never
// headlines a label. The card carries a non-dismissible line that cycle change
// has many causes — thyroid, stress, weight change, contraception, PCOS — and
// that this is a prompt to ask a clinician, not an answer.
