// WELLNESS — relative skin-temp circadian analysis.
//
// Catalog: "Wrist circadian-temp: cosinor + IS/IV/RA/L5/M10 (Sarabia/Madrid
// 2008). Best-matched to our relative single-site sensor; no calibration.
// ANTIPHASE to core — de-mask with activity/ambient." `24/7 · MED-HIGH (phase
// only)`.
//
// Two complementary descriptions of the daily rhythm on the RELATIVE skin-temp
// ADC (raw counts, NEVER °C):
//   1. Parametric cosinor (reuse clinical/cosinor.dart) -> acrophase/amplitude.
//   2. Nonparametric circadian statistics (Witting/van Someren):
//      IS  interdaily stability       (rhythm strength vs population of days)
//      IV  intradaily variability      (fragmentation)
//
// M10, L5 AND RA ARE WITHHELD — not null-when-unobserved, absent from the type.
// The series this runs on is median-centred, so it is SIGNED, and
// RA = (M10−L5)/(M10+L5) has a denominator that crosses zero: the "relative
// amplitude" flips sign and blows up on a series whose warm and cool windows
// straddle the centre. M10/L5 go with it because their only published use is
// RA and because a "warmest 10 h" of a centred series is not a level. IS/IV
// need no such level and stay.
//
// PER-DEVICE (device.dart contract). gen4 reports skin temperature as a raw
// ADC count and gen5 as centi-°C; they arrive in ONE array with no unit. A
// cosinor amplitude is unit-bearing, so an amplitude computed here is only
// comparable to another of the SAME family — hence [TempCircadian.unit], which
// exists so that no screen and no aggregate ever puts the two side by side.
// The de-mask motion gate is also per-family: on our own captures the resting
// accel noise floor differs ~4x between the families (gen4 |‖a‖−1| median
// 0.034 g / p90 0.058 g; gen5+MG median 0.007–0.012 g / p90 0.018–0.024 g), so
// one shared gate either de-masks half a gen4 night or nothing on a gen5 one.
// Unknown family REFUSES.
//
// HONESTY: phase only. No absolute °C, no fever, no core temperature, and the
// antiphase relationship to core is not to be quietly inverted for a nicer
// chart. Charging happens at a consistent time for most people, so the off-wrist
// gap is PHASE-LOCKED and biases the rhythm — the de-masking exists for that.
