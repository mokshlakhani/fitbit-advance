// RESPIRATION TIER-1 — CVHR / ACAT apnea SCREEN (Hayano 2011).
//
// Cyclic Variation of Heart Rate is the cardiac signature of sleep-disordered
// breathing: each apnea/hypopnea episode produces a bradycardia during the
// event followed by a tachycardia at the arousal/resumption of breathing,
// recurring with a ~20–120 s period. Hayano's Autonomic Cardiac Activity
// (ACAT) / ACT algorithm scores these cycles RR-only (r≈0.84 vs AHI), needs
// zero calibration, and runs all night on our continuous beat-to-beat RR — our
// structural edge.
//
// Method (ACAT-style, deterministic):
//   1. Build a 1 Hz HR-equivalent envelope from cleaned NN (instantaneous HR
//      = 60000/NN), smoothed with a 2nd-order (quadratic) Savitzky-Golay-like
//      local polynomial to suppress beat jitter while preserving cycle shape.
//   2. An adaptive baseline — the sliding MEDIAN over a ~130 s window, which
//      spans ≥2 apnea cycles so it tracks the eupneic level without being
//      pulled into any single event. The bradycardia is an NN MAXIMUM (NN ↑ ⇔
//      HR ↓), so the scored quantity is the POSITIVE excursion above that
//      baseline; negative excursions (the recovery tachycardia) are clipped.
//      A run clears the baseline when it exceeds max(0.5 × the 75th percentile
//      of the positive excursions, 5 ms) — the only percentile in this file.
//   3. Keep a run as a CVHR cycle only if its width is 10–120 s AND its
//      depth-to-width ratio > 0.7 ms/s (the steep bradycardia-then-tachycardia
//      signature, not slow drift).
//   4. CVHR cycles per hour => an apnea SCREEN index (NOT an AHI, NOT a
//      diagnosis). Report night-to-night variability caveat.
//
// HONESTY: this is a SCREEN. We never output an AHI or a clinical category, and
// we flag that single-night CVHR has substantial night-to-night variability.
// The denominator is OBSERVED time: the night is split at recording gaps, each
// contiguous stretch is analysed on its own, and the hole contributes neither
// interpolated beats nor hours. Dividing by the first-to-last span instead let
// a 2 h charging break cut the index from 80.0/h to 53.3/h on identical beats.
