// RESPIRATION TIER-1 — 24/7 respiratory rate from the 1 Hz substrate.
//
// Two independent estimators + an honest fusion gate:
//   * RSA respiratory rate (PRIMARY) — Lomb-Scargle HF-peak on cleaned NN beat
//     times. Respiratory sinus arrhythmia modulates RR at the breathing
//     frequency; the HF (0.15–0.40 Hz) spectral peak => breaths/min.
//     Welch 1967 segmentation: the peak is estimated on ~5-minute sub-windows
//     and the night's rate is the MEDIAN across them; the robustness check is
//     agreement of those sub-windows with each other. See [rsaRespRate] for why
//     the whole-window periodogram it replaced could not work.
//   * RIIV respiratory rate — band-pass 0.1–0.5 Hz on the 1 Hz green PPG ADC
//     (respiratory-induced intensity variation), peak frequency => breaths/min.
//   * Karlen 2013 SD-gate fusion — discard a window when the two estimates
//     disagree by more than a threshold (Smart Fusion), else inverse-variance
//     fuse them into a single honest rate.
//
// HONESTY CEILINGS:
//   * RIIV rides the 1 Hz green ADC, whose Nyquist caps any rate at 0.5 Hz =
//     30 br/min. We refuse to report a peak at/above that ceiling (aliasing).
//   * RSA rides the TACHOGRAM, which is sampled once per BEAT, not once per
//     second — so its ceiling is the beat-rate Nyquist (0.5/meanNN), ~37 br/min
//     at HR 75 but only ~25 br/min at HR 50. [rsaRespRate] computes that
//     ceiling per window, caps it at [respHiHz], and withholds the whole window
//     when that ceiling falls below the classic HF band (the alias would be
//     indistinguishable from a genuine slower rate). A rate the window cannot
//     resolve is ABSENT, never a spurious in-band peak dressed up as a normal
//     number.
//   * Neither estimator can see a TRUE rate above [respHiHz] (30 br/min). Such
//     a window yields a low peak near the ceiling, not an absence — sustained
//     adult tachypnea is outside what this module claims to measure.
//   * RSA is HIGH tier (continuous 24/7, the structural edge); RIIV is MED
//     (1 Hz green is a coarse intensity proxy, not the 419 Hz waveform).
//   * Absent / insufficient input => null + confidence 0, never a guess.

/// "a deterministic analogue" of Pimentel 2017's AR-model-order surrogate. It
/// is not one. Refining a grid re-reads the SAME spectrum, and over a night
/// that spectrum's bins are spaced ~30× finer than the grid step, so the three
/// grids were drawing three near-independent noise samples: measured on 14 real
/// nights the three peaks scattered by up to 8 br/min, the gate withheld 17 of
/// 30 nights, and on nights it did publish the number was often not even the
/// band's true maximum (one night published 10.66 br/min where the same night's
/// sub-windows agree on 16.96, and the fine-grid maximum was 18.55). Same night
/// replayed twice with a 24-minute-longer sleep window: withheld once, 17.56
/// the other time. The citation went with it — this is Welch segmentation, not
/// Pimentel's surrogate.
///
/// [tolBrpm] 2.0 and [minConsensus] 0.5 are calibrated against a SURROGATE null
/// (the same nights with their NN values shuffled, which destroys RSA and keeps
/// the sampling geometry): surrogate consensus measured 15–28% across 14 real
/// nights, real consensus 52–85%. Uniform peaks over the ~21 br/min searchable
/// band would put ±2 br/min agreement at 19% by chance, which is what the
