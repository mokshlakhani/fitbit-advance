// MOTION / ACTIVITY — per-minute amplitude indices on a 1 Hz accel stream.
//
// THREE per-minute features live here, computed in one pass:
//
//   ENMO_i   = max(0, ‖a_i‖ − g_ref)                  per sample, mean/minute
//              (van Hees 2013, Euclidean Norm Minus One)
//   MAD_min  = mean_i( |‖a_i‖ − mean_min(‖a‖)| )      per minute
//              (Vähä-Ypyä 2015, Mean Amplitude Deviation)
//   dynAmp   = mean_i( ‖a_i − rollingMean(a)‖ )       per minute  ← see below
//
// WHY dynAmp EXISTS (calibration invariance).
//   ENMO subtracts a SCALAR gravity reference `g_ref` from every sample. That
//   reference has to be estimated from the data, and on a wrist the estimate is
//   orientation-dependent: a consumer MEMS accel carries a few percent of
//   per-axis gain and offset error, so the measured ‖a‖ of a motionless wrist
//   differs by several 0.01 g between, say, a sleeping posture and a sitting
//   posture. Auto-calibration keys off the stillest epochs, which on a 24 h day
//   is the sleep block — so g_ref is biased toward the sleep orientation and is
//   then subtracted from the whole waking day. The resulting bias is the SAME
//   ORDER as the walking signal itself (both ~0.05 g), i.e. SNR ≈ 1 by
//   construction. No threshold on ENMO can be stable against that.
//
//   Vähä-Ypyä 2015 makes exactly this argument for preferring an amplitude
//   measure that does not depend on knowing ‖g‖. dynAmp takes it one step
//   further and removes gravity as a VECTOR rather than as a scalar norm:
//   gravity is constant in the SENSOR frame over a short window, motion is AC,
//   so a per-axis high-pass leaves only the dynamic component.
//
//     dx_i = a_i − rollingMean(a over the last `highPassWindowS` seconds)
//     dyn_i = ‖dx_i‖ ,  dynAmp(minute) = mean(dyn over the minute)
//
//   Under a per-axis affine sensor error a' = G·a + b (G diagonal gain, b
//   offset), the rolling mean maps to G·mean + b, so the OFFSET b CANCELS
//   EXACTLY — every constant per-axis bias, including whatever gravity happens
//   to project onto each axis in the current posture, lands in the DC term and
//   is removed. A residual gain G only SCALES dyn, so any threshold expressed
//   as a quantile of the user's own dynAmp distribution is invariant to it too.
//
// HONESTY (catalog §"what 1 Hz accel CANNOT do", Nyquist):
//   * 1 Hz accel gives an AMPLITUDE index only. NO steps, NO cadence, NO gait,
//     NO frequency-domain activity classification (gait is 1.4–2.5 Hz, far
//     above the 0.5 Hz Nyquist limit of a 1 Hz stream).
//   * Intensity bands here are RELATIVE (within-user, percentile-of-you),
//     NOT absolute METs — wrist 1 Hz cannot calibrate energy in MET units.
//   * The 1 g reference is AUTO-CALIBRATED from the data's own still epochs,
//     since the sensor's zero-g offset/gain drift. [calibrateGRef] and [enmo]
//     are RETAINED for the callers that legitimately want a norm-based index
//     (van Hees sleep detection, Brage energy fusion) — but any decision that
//     needs a STABLE absolute cut-point should use [MotionMinute.dynAmp].
