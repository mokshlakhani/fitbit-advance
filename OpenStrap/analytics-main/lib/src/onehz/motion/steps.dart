// MOTION — a real pedometer on one stream, movement volume on the other.
//
// The honest constraint (see motion.dart §"what 1 Hz accel CANNOT do"):
//   * The always-on 24/7 substrate is 1 Hz accel. Human gait is 1.4–2.5 Hz, far
//     above the 0.5 Hz Nyquist limit of a 1 Hz stream — so you CANNOT count
//     individual steps from the stored substrate. Full stop. And even at full
//     rate a WRIST ranks arm work above walking, so amplitude alone cannot
//     isolate gait from cooking or driving.
//   * Real per-step detection is only possible on the ~100 Hz foreground accel
//     (R10 / 0x2B), which exists only while the app is connected and streaming.
//
// So we split the problem the only honest way:
//
//   TIER A — [pedometer] / [livePedometer]: a real step counter on the 100 Hz
//     foreground stream, ported from the OpenStrap backend
//     (openstrap-analytics/src/steps.ts). See [StepParams] for what it actually
//     is and is not — it is NOT AN-2554 verbatim, and the ×1.11 "calibration"
//     it used to carry was measured to be a fabricated +10.6%. Its CONFIRM=8
//     regularity gate rejects IRREGULAR handling and reads 0 at rest; it does
//     NOT reject rhythmic arm work (measured: a steady 1.8 Hz stir over 300 s
//     of no locomotion counts 538 steps at 108 spm). Directly testable: walk N
//     steps with the app open and compare.
//
//   TIER B — [dailyActiveMinutes]: a 24/7 MOVEMENT-VOLUME index from the 1 Hz
//     substrate. It reports MINUTES OF SUSTAINED WRIST MOVEMENT and NOTHING
//     ELSE. It emits no step count and no cadence, because at 1 Hz gait is
//     unidentifiable (aliasing) AND wrist amplitude ranks arm work above
//     walking, so a movement threshold cannot isolate ambulation in principle.
//     A previous version multiplied these minutes by a cadence band; it was
//     measured over-reporting ~6× on a real day and has been removed. Steps
//     come only from a gait-capable source (Tier A, or the phone pedometer).
//
//     Two things make the minute detector stable, and both matter:
//       1. The feature is [MotionMinute.dynAmp] — per-axis high-passed dynamic
//          amplitude — NOT ENMO. ENMO is not empty on this substrate (audit
//          MOT-07 re-measured it: Spearman(ENMO, HR) = 0.244 vs
//          Spearman(dynAmp, HR) = 0.689 over 11,205 covered gen4 minutes), it
//          is CALIBRATION-FRAGILE: it is `‖a‖ − gRef` and the per-family gRef
//          (1.0277 gen4 / 1.0014 MG / 0.9977 W5) is the same order as the
//          movement it is supposed to measure. dynAmp removes gravity as a
//          VECTOR and measures how fast the wrist re-orients, so no reference
//          has to be right. (Vähä-Ypyä 2015 argues for calibration-robust
//          amplitude measures over ENMO for exactly this reason.)
//       2. The cut-point is a MULTI-DAY PERSONAL REFERENCE
//          ([personalDynFloorFromDailySummaries]) that is FROZEN after an
//          enrollment window — neither an absolute g constant
//          (calibration-fragile) nor anything recomputed daily. A threshold
//          recomputed from the signal it thresholds cancels the trend it
//          exists to report: measured, 37 active minutes at 1×, 1.5×, 2× AND
//          3× activity, versus 23 → 254 with a frozen floor.
//
//     There is deliberately NO upper ceiling and NO HR gate. Both existed and
//     both were measured against real substrate: the ceiling rejected zero
//     minutes across every day tested, and the HR gate changed the answer by
//     zero minutes while sitting at ~6% of heart-rate reserve. See the
//     comments at their former sites in [dailyActiveMinutes] before
//     reintroducing either.
//
//     With no personal reference the estimator ABSTAINS (absent Metric with a
//     `need_baseline:` note). It never substitutes a constant — substituting a
//     constant IS the failure mode this design exists to prevent.
//
//   CALIBRATION — [StepCalibration] / [calibrateCadence]: measures THIS user's
//     real walking cadence from the 100 Hz stream. That number is reportable on
//     its own. It is deliberately NOT consumed by Tier B: multiplying movement
//     minutes by a walking cadence produces a number about nothing, because the
//     minutes are not specifically ambulation.
//
// Pure: dart:math only. No I/O, no clock, no randomness.

//
//   (a) An ABSOLUTE g cut-point on ENMO. ENMO = max(0, ‖a‖ − gRef), and gRef is
//       estimated per-day from the stillest samples. On a wrist those are the
//       sleep block, whose orientation differs from the waking day; with a few
//       percent of per-axis gain/offset error the still ‖a‖ can differ by
//       ~0.05 g between postures. That bias is added to EVERY waking minute,
//       and it is the same size as the walking signal itself. Sweeping gRef
//       over one real day's raw data moved the daily total from ~42 000 steps
//       to 0 with no stable plateau in between — SNR ≈ 1 by construction.
//
//   (b) A SAME-DAY RELATIVE baseline (e.g. today's p20 + k·MAD). This fails in
//       mirror image: on a genuinely quiet day the baseline collapses toward
//       zero, the floor collapses with it, and ordinary sedentary minutes clear
//       it. Same real day, same failure magnitude, opposite direction.

///
///   1. NYQUIST. Gait is 1.4–2.3 Hz (Straczkiewicz 2023, npj Digit Med,
///      doi:10.1038/s41746-022-00745-z). At 1 Hz sampling every gait
///      fundamental is sub-Nyquist and the alias map is many-to-one: 80, 100,
///      140 and 160 spm all alias to 0.333 Hz. Cadence is not merely noisy, it
///      is NOT IDENTIFIABLE. No published step detector exists below 10 Hz.
///
///   2. AMPLITUDE IS INVERTED AT THE WRIST. Walking produces LESS wrist
///      acceleration than ordinary arm work — walking ≈ 66 mg ENMO vs stirring
///      ≈ 104 mg and chopping ≈ 139 mg. So a movement threshold cannot isolate
///      walking: walking sits mid-pack in a normal day's distribution. Wrist
///      devices are documented to emit 22–27 false steps/min during dishes,
///      reaching and cycling (O'Connell 2017, PLoS ONE,
///      doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0169616) while detecting slow walking with
///      sensitivity 0.05 — the two errors have OPPOSITE sign, so no gain
///      constant can fix both.
///
/// A real step count must come from a source that can see gait: the Tier A
/// 100 Hz pedometer ([pedometer]/[livePedometer]) or the phone's own pedometer.
/// Absent those, the honest output is no number at all.
///
/// What IS resolvable at 1 Hz is whether a minute contained sustained movement,
/// which is what this returns. A covered minute counts when BOTH of these hold:
///   • its [MotionMinute.dynAmp] is above [personalDynFloorG];
///   • it belongs to a run of at least [minBoutMin] CONSECUTIVE qualifying
///     minutes, where consecutive means ADJACENT ON THE CLOCK — the next
///     minute's `tsMinStartMs` is exactly 60 s later. A coverage gap breaks the
///     run and cannot stitch two short stretches into one qualifying bout. This
///     is a DENOISER, not a health threshold: the 2018 US Physical Activity
///     Guidelines removed the 10-minute minimum-bout rule, so do not defend
///     this number physiologically.
///
/// [expectedMinutes] mirrors `enmoSeries`: pass 1440 for a calendar day so
/// [DailyMovementEstimate.coverage] is measured against the day rather than
/// against the worn span. Without it, a day worn 4 h out of 24 reports 1.0
/// while `enmoSeries` reports 0.167 for the identical substrate.
///
/// There is deliberately no upper ceiling and no HR gate. Both were measured
/// against real substrate and found to be dead or harmful — see the comments
/// at their former sites before reintroducing either.
///
/// [personalDynFloorG] is REQUIRED and MAY BE NULL. Null means "not enough
/// history to know this user's movement scale", and the honest answer to that
/// is an ABSENT metric carrying a `need_baseline:have=…,need=…` note — build
/// the floor with [personalDynFloorFromDailySummaries] and pass
/// [historyDaysAvailable] so the note can report progress. There is
/// deliberately NO constant fallback: a constant absolute floor is precisely
/// the failure this design removes.
///
/// The note counts DAYS, against [personalDynFloorMinDays]. It used to count
/// them against [personalDynFloorMinMinutes] (2000) while every caller passed a
/// day count, so a user three days in was told `have=3,need=2000` — ~1997 more
/// of a unit nobody was measuring, for a metric that unlocks in two.

/// This function is intentionally independent of the 100 Hz pedometer: it
