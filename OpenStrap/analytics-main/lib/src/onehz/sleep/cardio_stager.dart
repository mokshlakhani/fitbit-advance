// SLEEP — transparent cardiorespiratory stager (NO ML).
//
// Replaces the Walch 2019 logistic model. Rationale (validated on real data):
//   • Walch over-calls WAKE — its motion-`count` feature carries a +10.64 wake
//     weight, so normal in-sleep repositioning flips epochs to wake (a solid
//     night read 63% efficiency).
//   • Walch needs a 50 Hz band-pass activity count we CANNOT compute at 1 Hz —
//     we fed an ENMO substitute, a train/serve mismatch baked in.
//   • Walch IGNORES beat-to-beat RR — our single best signal. Sleep stages have
//     a textbook autonomic signature in HR + HRV; we should use it.
//
// This stager is fully transparent: every label traces to a threshold on a real
// signal, z-scored against the SLEEPER'S OWN night baseline (no population model,
// no training). Published basis: Webster/Cole-Kripke actigraphy (wake) + HRV-
// based cardiorespiratory staging (REM = autonomic activation w/ low RMSSD;
// NREM = parasympathetic, high RMSSD; deep = HR/HRV trough).
//
// Per 30-s epoch we measure, over the in-bed window only:
//   motion = mean ENMO (van Hees 2013 amplitude index, g), against a LOCALLY
//            re-estimated 1 g reference (see below), NOT a whole-night scalar
//   hr     = mean valid HR (bpm)          hrSd = within-epoch SD of HR (bpm)
//   rmssd, sdnn = over a ±2.5-min RR window (ms)
//   lfhf, Rk    = over a ±90-s RR window
// then classify against the night's own baselines:
//   WAKE  : clearly elevated motion OR HR arousal above a LOCAL sleeping HR
//           median (a 90-min rolling window, not the whole night)
//   REM   : weighted score over Rk / sdnn / hrSd / lfhf above a cutoff, GATED
//           by atonia (no big movement) and HR ≥ a LOCAL p25 floor
//   DEEP  : weighted score over the same axes in the opposite direction
//           (NREM subtype, low confidence)
//   LIGHT : remaining NREM
//
// 2026-08 — WHY SCORES, NOT CONJUNCTIONS, AND WHY NOT RMSSD. The rules above
// replace an earlier design that AND-ed boolean gates and used an RMSSD drop as
// the PRIMARY REM detector. Measured against 99 PSG-labelled wrist nights
// (DREAMT) via `tool/stager_harness.dart`, that design scored kappa 0.036 —
// deep PPV 5.7% against a 4.5% base rate, REM PPV 12.1% against 14.0%, i.e. at
// or below chance for both minority classes. Per-subject effect sizes explain
// why: RMSSD did not separate the stages in our measurement (54% of subjects,
// d -0.02) — BUT SEE THE NEXT PARAGRAPH, that number is probably wrong — mean
// HR in deep sleep runs
// HIGHER than light on the wrist (62% of subjects, d +0.31 — the old gate was
// inverted), and the two axes that DO separate (Rk d -0.53/+0.43, sdnn
// -0.41/+0.32) were respectively throttled to z>4 and not computed at all.
// AND-ing one good gate with one null and one inverted gate is why deep sleep
// emerged as isolated 30-second specks that the 3-min bout rule then deleted.
// A weighted sum degrades gracefully where a conjunction vetoes.
//
// THE RMSSD d -0.02 IS PROBABLY WRONG, AND IT IS NOT HERZIG'S FAULT (SLP-06).
// R(k) is defined below as mean |ΔIHR| over the window — a successive-difference
// statistic on the SAME beat train RMSSD uses, differing only by the 1/RR²
// rescaling and mean-abs vs RMS. Measured on three real rest blocks at the
// windows this file actually uses (R(k) ±90 s, RMSSD ±150 s) they correlate
// 0.876 / 0.778 / 0.778; at a matched ±90 s, 0.928 / 0.853 / 0.856. And
// corr(R(k), mean HR) is 0.065 / 0.282 / -0.341, so R(k) is not a disguised
// heart-rate feature either. Two statistics correlated 0.78-0.93 on the target
// signal cannot both score d -0.02 and d -0.53 against the same labels; under a
// bivariate-normal argument RMSSD should be at least ~0.4 in the same
// direction. So the local DREAMT effect-size measurement for RMSSD is
// unreliable and Herzig 2017 is currently lending its authority to it.
// TODO: re-run the DREAMT effect size for RMSSD at ±90 s and publish both
// numbers side by side. DO NOT move the shipped weights on the strength of
// this — it says the measurement is untrustworthy, not which way it moves.
// Post: Webster continuity rescore (bridges brief arousals into sleep — this is
// what kills the over-call) + consolidateSleepStages (no single-epoch flicker).
//
// LOCAL vs WHOLE-NIGHT baselines (2026-07, real-data root cause): a real WHOOP-4
// capture showed BOTH the motion and HR features have night-scale
// non-stationarity a single whole-night scalar cannot track — see the detailed
// comments at each baseline below (gravity-magnitude posture drift; sleep-onset
// HR-decay transient; REM's own periodic-elevation self-dilution of a local
// median). Motion's still/bigMove REPOSITIONING thresholds remain whole-night
// scalars deliberately — only the ABSOLUTE-MAGNITUDE references (1 g; sleeping
// HR) needed to become local.
//
// HONESTY: a wrist 3-class (+low-confidence deep) ESTIMATE, never PSG/EEG.
// tier ESTIMATE; confidence reflects RR coverage (RMSSD drives REM/deep).
