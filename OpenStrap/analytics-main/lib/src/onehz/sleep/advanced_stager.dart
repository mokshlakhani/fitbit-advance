// SLEEP — AdvancedSleepStager: session DETECTION (shared by every staging
// method below) + per-session STAGING, now delegating to [StagingMethod].
//
// Detection pipeline (unchanged by the 2026-07 staging swap below): the
// Cole–Kripke sleep/wake spine + the full session-detection guards (daytime
// #90, morning-stillness #531, 16h cap #547, off-wrist #500, sparse gravity
// #308).
//
// Per-session STAGING (the [StagingMethod] this file offers):
//   - [StagingMethod.cardio] (DEFAULT since 2026-07) — delegates to
//     `cardioStager` (cardio_stager.dart): a transparent, night-baseline-
//     relative HR+motion+RMSSD classifier with no dependency on a
//     respiration channel. Chosen after a head-to-head comparison against
//     v1/v2 on a clean fixture AND a realistic multi-phase/noisy synthetic
//     fixture: cardio matched the intended deep/REM proportions far more
//     closely (v1/v2 both badly under-called deep sleep — 0.8-2.3% of TST
//     vs cardio's 12.8%, vs a ~17% intended ground truth), and on a fixture
//     with NO genuine REM signature, cardio correctly reported 0% REM where
//     v1/v2 both hallucinated some. See git history / PR description for
//     the full numeric comparison.
//   - [StagingMethod.v1] — the original Stage-1 per-epoch features (30 s
//     epochs, 5-min window, DoG HR-variability σ=120/600, pooled-RR RMSSD/
//     SDNN, RR-derived-EDR breathing-variability) + Stage-2 percentile-band
//     classifier + Stage-3 median smoothing/physiology. NOT recommended for
//     production (see cardio comparison above) — kept for regression
//     coverage only. (A real 2026-07 bug in this path was fixed here too:
//     its REM detection depended on a raw respiration-ADC channel WHOOP 4
//     never provides, so it was silently always-dead in production; see
//     `_rrvFromRrSeries`. That fix is what makes this a fair v1 in the
//     comparison above, not evidence v1 should still be used.)
//   - [StagingMethod.v2] — the z-scored emission model + deep HR-flatness
//     gate + cycle prior + sticky 4×4 Viterbi HMM. Also NOT recommended
//     (see comparison above) — kept for regression coverage only.
//
// HONESTY: a wrist 4-class autonomic ESTIMATE, never PSG/EEG. tier ESTIMATE.
// Pure Dart, dart:math only.

  // ── Cole–Kripke sleep/wake spine — KNOWN CATALOG DEVIATION (deliberate) ─────
  // docs/ALGORITHM_CATALOG_1HZ.md lists "Cole-Kripke / Sadeh / Oakley raw
  // coefficients on 1 Hz" under DO NOT SHIP, because the published weights were
  // calibrated against Actigraph zero-crossing / PIM counts and that count
  // calibration does not transfer to a 1 Hz gravity-delta surrogate (ZCM is
  // aliased away below Nyquist). We use the classic weights ANYWAY here, and it
  // is tolerated for three specific reasons:
  //   1. SPINE ONLY. `_coleKripke` output is used exclusively to locate sleep
  //      ONSET / FINAL-WAKE (`_onsetAndFinalWake`) and to pick the "sleep" epoch
  //      subset for the percentile bands — it never assigns a final stage label.
  //   2. CORRECTED DOWNSTREAM. The actual hypnogram comes from Stage 1-3
  //      (per-epoch HR/HRV/RR/resp features -> percentile classifier -> median
  //      smoothing -> `_reimposePhysiology`), which overrides the raw CK call,
  //      and physiology is reimposed after.
  //   3. RELATIVE, NOT ABSOLUTE. `_rescaleCounts` normalises by the epoch's
  //      sample count (via the measured cadence) and divides by
  //      `ckCountDivisor` and clips, so the spine reacts to WITHIN-NIGHT
  //      relative motion, not to an absolute count threshold the surrogate
  //      cannot honor — and not to how fast the device happens to sample.
  // The van Hees angle window remains the primary in-bed detector (the catalog's
  // sanctioned method); CK is a secondary within-window continuity spine. Do NOT
  // read CK output as a validated sleep/wake score. The catalog DO-NOT-SHIP line
