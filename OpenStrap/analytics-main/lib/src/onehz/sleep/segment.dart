// SLEEP — SINGLE-SOURCE segmentation entry point.
//
// ARCHITECTURE_V2 invariant 2/4 + "Segmentation (FROZEN — single source)":
// exactly ONE sleep/wake/stage windowing. No component re-detects sleep; every
// downstream figure (TST, WASO, efficiency, stage minutes, hypnogram) derives
// from the SAME per-second stage labels produced here. There is no second
// estimator — this is THE source.
//
// Pipeline:
//   1. vanHeesSleepWindow(accel) → the per-second immobility mask + z-angle
//      series ONLY. Its `onsetIdx`/`offsetIdx` are NOT the published window and
//      never have been — this file used to claim they were. The window comes
//      from step 2; van Hees survives here as the immobility/arm-angle
//      primitive that `stages4` and the nap detector share, and as the
//      `fallbackWindow` whose masks are forwarded.
//   2. AdvancedSleepStager.detectSleep/stageWindow — THE window
//      ([_pickMainSleepGroup] over the detected sessions, or the caller's
//      forced window) — staged via
//      StagingMethod.cardio (the default — delegates to cardioStager, the
//      transparent motion+HR+RMSSD rule stager; see advanced_stager.dart's
//      file header for the 2026-07 comparison behind this default) → 4-class
//      wake/light/deep/rem per epoch, over the WINDOW SLICE ONLY.
//   3. Expand the per-epoch stages to PER-SECOND labels over the window, mark
//      every second we did not actually observe as 'unobserved' (step 4), and
//      derive TST/WASO/efficiency/stage-seconds ALL from those labels
//      (asleep = stage != wake), so they are mutually consistent and consistent
//      with any hypnogram built from `stages`.
//   4. UNOBSERVED time. The window is wall-clock; the substrate is a POSITIONAL
//      array with holes, and HR is intermittent. A second with no sample, or
//      with no heart rate anywhere near it, is labelled 'unobserved' and counts
//      into NOTHING — not TST, not WASO, not wake, not the efficiency
//      denominator. It is published as [SleepSegmentation.unobservedSec] so the
//      UI can state the reason instead of implying a measurement.
//
// HONESTY: if no qualifying sleep (no window, in-bed < ~3 h, staging cannot
// run, or too little of the window was observed) we return
// SleepSegmentation.absent — everything null, confidence 0, with
// [SleepSegmentation.absenceReason] set where the cause is known. Never
// fabricated. Stages are tier ESTIMATE (3-class autonomic, not PSG).
