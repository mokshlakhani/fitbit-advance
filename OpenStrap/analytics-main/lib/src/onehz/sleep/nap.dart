// SLEEP — daytime nap detection.
//
// WHY THIS IS NOT `AdvancedSleepStager.detectSleep`
// -------------------------------------------------
// The nocturnal detector rejects naps ON PURPOSE. `minSleepMin = 60` exists so
// "daytime naps and stray still-blocks stay excluded" (advanced_stager.dart),
// and any period centred 11:00–20:00 local must additionally clear
// `daytimeMinSleepMin = 90` plus a resting-HR dip. Those gates are load-bearing
// for NIGHT accuracy, so they are not loosened here. Naps get their own
// detector instead, run strictly on the complement of the main sleep window.
//
// METHOD
//   1. van Hees z-angle immobility (`immobilityMask`). An angle is
//      orientation-invariant, so it does not inherit the ~13% spread in |accel|
//      across static wrist postures that makes magnitude-based stillness
//      false-positive on a merely resting arm.
//      NOT the nocturnal spine's stillness test — this used to claim it was.
//      `AdvancedSleepStager` uses `_gravityDeltas`, the norm of the DIFFERENCE
//      between successive gravity vectors. Both are orientation-CHANGE
//      detectors and neither is the |accel| magnitude test van_hees.dart argues
//      against, but they are different features over different windows and the
//      two detectors have never been shown to agree on real nights.
//   2. Enumerate EVERY immobility bout (the nocturnal path keeps only the
//      longest), bridging brief arousals.
//   3. Reject hard: off-wrist, charging/workout spans, the main sleep window,
//      and bouts built on seconds the band never measured (`minNapAccelCoverage`).
//   4. Require an autonomic signature — median HR inside the bout at or below
//      `napRestingHrMult` × the DAYTIME-AWAKE HR baseline. Stillness alone is
//      also desk work, reading and a car passenger seat.
//   5. Abstain rather than guess when HR coverage inside a bout is too thin.
//
// HONESTY CEILING. This is an ESTIMATE from a 1 Hz wrist gravity vector plus
// opportunistic HR, never PSG. It reports WHETHER and HOW LONG, and makes no
// sleep-stage claim: a 30-minute nap contains no complete sleep cycle, and the
// daytime HR duty cycle will not support a 4-class partition. Time asleep and
// time in bed are reported separately and are never conflated.
//
// NO TIMEZONE DEPENDENCE, by construction. Corroboration is physiological (an
// HR dip against the user's own awake baseline), not clock-based, so a nap does
// not appear or vanish with the machine's local offset.
