// SLEEP/CIRCADIAN — Cardiopulmonary Coupling (CPC). WITHDRAWN.
//
// IF YOU GOT HERE FROM A GREP: this function has zero callers ON PURPOSE. it is
// not an oversight, not half-wired, not waiting for someone with time. every
// sweep of this repo re-proposes it, because a tested function with no caller
// reads as a loose end from the outside and as a decision only once you open
// the file. you have opened the file. the reason is below, and edge's
// compute/onehz_pipeline.dart records the same verdict where the call would go.
//
// Thomas et al. 2005 (Sleep) derives CPC from the cross-spectral coherence of
// TWO signals: the RR tachogram, and an ECG-DERIVED RESPIRATION (EDR) surrogate
// taken from the R-wave amplitude — a separate channel that is modulated by
// breathing but is NOT a function of the beat times.
//
// This implementation had no such channel. Its "respiration surrogate" was the
// NN series itself, linearly detrended:
//
//     resp = detrend([v - mean(nnMs) for v in nnMs])
//
// which differs from the tachogram only by a straight line. The coupling
// spectrum sqrt(P_rr . P_resp) therefore collapses to P_rr, and `cpc_ratio`
// came out equal to the plain RR periodogram HF/LF ratio — measured 84.493910
// vs 84.493190 on a 9000-beat synthetic, a ratio of 1.0000085. It was the LF/HF
// of the same tachogram we already publish as `lf_hf`, wearing the name of a
// different, published, sleep-stability measure.
//
// The honest options were "derive a real EDR" or "stop shipping it". We cannot
// derive an EDR here — this function is handed beat intervals and beat times
// and nothing else, and a respiration channel independent of the tachogram is
// by definition not recoverable from them. So the metric is WITHDRAWN: it now
// abstains, with the reason attached, and the UI element it fed should be
// DELETED rather than made to explain a dash.
//
// Wiring it back up means changing the signature to take an actual respiration
// channel (PPG AC amplitude / RIIV, cf. respiration/resp_rate.dart) and
// validating the result against something. Until then there is no number here.
//
// RSA-derived respiration DOES NOT QUALIFY as that channel. it comes out of the
// same tachogram, so it reproduces exactly the failure above with more steps.
// the input has to be independent of the beat times or the coupling spectrum
// collapses again, and shipping the collapse under a clinical-sounding name is
// republishing `lf_hf` — already charted — as a second, fake metric.
